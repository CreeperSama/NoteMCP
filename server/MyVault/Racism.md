<h1>Racism</h1><p>Racism is a systemic and deeply rooted form of prejudice that categorizes and devalues individuals based on their perceived racial or ethnic identity. It isn't just a collection of personal biases or isolated acts of unkindness; rather, it often functions as a <strong>structural framework</strong> that dictates access to power, resources, and opportunities. From institutional barriers in housing and employment to the subtle "microaggressions" encountered in daily life, racism creates an unequal playing field that persists across generations.</p><p>Addressing racism requires more than just "not being a racist." It demands an active commitment to <strong>anti-racism</strong>, which involves:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> Examining our own unconscious biases and how we might benefit from existing systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Education:</strong> Learning the historical contexts that built modern disparities.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Challenging discriminatory policies and supporting equity in our local communities.</p><p>True progress lies in moving beyond tolerance toward a genuine celebration of human diversity, ensuring that a person's skin color never acts as a ceiling for their potential.</p><p></p><p></p>
